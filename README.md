# Tipper# Pre-work - *Tipperv2*

**Tipper** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Alex Hachey**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total, although I had many issues uploading to github using github desktop.  I have been at a conference while trying to upload and I think the firewall or network that I'm on may have contributed to my issues but I eventually uploaded directly via Github's web interface.  My project files are located in the "Tipperv2" folder here: https://github.com/adhachey/Tippy-Chi-Yay/tree/master/Tipper%20V2.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, indicate the wuality of your service across "friendliness," "Speed" and "Accuracy," and see a recommended tip and total values, based on the service you received.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Custom font
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Additional toggle fields capturing quality of service/experience
- [X] Tip recommendation is generated based on the quality of service you received across the general categories, "friendliness," "speed" and "accuracy."

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Setting up github desktop could not work for me.  For some reason setting up a project through github desktop wasn't working.  I would hit publish and get many different errors.  This seemed to work for me on my own network at home but not while attending a conference.
